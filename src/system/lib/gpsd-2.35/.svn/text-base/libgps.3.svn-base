.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBlibgps\fR
is a service library which supports querying GPS devices; link it with the linker option \-lgps\&. There are two interfaces supported in it; one high\-level interface that goes through
\fBgpsd\fR(1)
and is intended for concurrent use by several applications, and one low\-level interface that speaks directly with the serial or USB device to which the GPS is attached\&. This page describes the high\-level interface that is safe for multiple applications to use simultaneously; it is probably the one you want\&. The low\-level interface is documented at
\fBlibgpsd\fR(3)\&.
.PP
Calling
\fBgps_open()\fR
initializes a GPS\-data structure to hold the data collected by the GPS, and returns a socket attached to
\fBgpsd\fR(1)\&.
\fBgps_open()\fR
returns NULL on errors\&. errno is set depending on the error returned from the the socket layer; see
gps\&.h
for values and explanations\&.
.PP
\fBgps_close()\fR
ends the session\&.
.PP
\fBgps_poll()\fR
accepts a response, or sequence of responses, from the daemon and interprets it as though it were a query response (the return value is as for a query)\&.
\fBgps_poll()\fR
returns the validity mask of the received structure\&. This function does a blocking read waiting for data from the daemon; it returns 0 for success, or \-1 on a Unix\-level read error\&.
.PP
\fBgps_query()\fR
writes a command to the daemon, accepts a one\-line response, and updates parts of the GPS\-data structure that correspond to data changed since the last call\&. The second argument must be a format string containing letters from the command set documented at
\fBgpsd\fR(1)\&. It may have % elements as for
\fBsprintf\fR(3), which will be filled in from any following arguments\&. This function returns a 0 on success, or a \-1 if there was a Unix\-level read error\&.
.PP
\fBgps_set_raw_hook()\fR
takes a function you specify and run it (synchronously) on the raw data pulled by a
\fBgps_query()\fR
or
\fBgps_poll()\fR
call\&. The arguments passed to this hook will be a pointer to a structure containing parsed data, and a buffer containining the raw
gpsd
response\&.
.PP
\fBgps_set_callback()\fR
takes a function you specify and runs it asynchronously each time new data arrives from
gpsd, using POSIX threads\&. For example, you can call gps_set_callback(gpsdata, my_function, handler) once in your program, and from there on your gpsdata structure will be parsed by your
\fBmy_function()\fR
each time new data are available\&.
\fBmy_function()\fR
could change some global variables in your program based on received data; it is your responsibility to ensure that your program uses mutexes or other mechanisms to avoid race conditions\&.
.PP
\fBgps_del_callback()\fR
deregisters the callback function previously set with
\fBgps_set_callback()\fR\&. After the invocation of this function no operation will be done when new data arrives\&.
.PP
Consult
gps\&.h
to learn more about the data members and associated timestamps\&. Note that information will accumulate in the session structure over time, and the \*(Aqvalid\*(Aq field is not automatically zeroed by each poll\&. It is up to the client to zero that field when appropriate and to keep an eye on the fix and sentence timestamps\&.
.PP
The
\fBrtcm_unpack()\fR
will be useful when you are connected to an RTCM\-104 source in raw mode\&. Use it as part of a raw hook, calling it with the address of the
struct rtcm_t
element of your session structure buffer as first argument and the buffer as the second\&. It will unpack a line of RTCM data into the structure\&. This function returns 0 when it has read the last line of an RTCM\-104 message, a positive int when it expects more dump lines, and a negative int on parse failure\&. You must zero out the
struct rtcm_t
each time before this function is called on a new header (H) line, as it relies on the message type field being initially zero and uses it to track what kind of following line is expected\&.
.PP
The Python implementation supports the same facilities as the C library\&.
\fBgps_open()\fR
is replaced by the initialization of a gps session object; the other calls are methods of that object, and have the same names as the corresponding C functions\&. Resources within the session object will be properly released when it is garbage\-collected\&.
.SH "CODE EXAMPLE"
.PP
The following is an excerpted and simplified version of the libgps interface code from
\fBgps\fR(1)\&. The function
\fBhandle_input()\fR
is a trivial pies of code that calls gps_poll(gpsdata)\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    gpsdata = gps_open(server, port);

    build_gui(toplevel);

    gps_set_raw_hook(gpsdata, update_panel);
	
    (void)gps_query(gpsdata, "w+x\en");

    (void)XtAppAddInput(app, gpsdata\->gps_fd, 
		  (XtPointer)XtInputReadMask, handle_input, NULL);
    (void)XtAppMainLoop(app);

    (void)gps_close(gpsdata);
